# VirtualLibrary

## Description
Virtual Library is a Windows Form application created in order to let users take or return books by themselves. 

## Features
* User can make himself an account in which he gives information such as "username", "surname", "name", "email", creates passwords and takes a portrait picture. 
* User can log in using his "username" or by showing his face (application detects and recognizes the user). 
* User can scan a book and choose to either take it or return it (once he is logged in). 
* User can see the information on what books he has already taken and the dates on when to return them (once he is logged in).
* Notification system (user gets an email - reminder on when to return books).
* User can choose the language of application- English or Lithuanian. 

## Installation
You can download the application here - https://github.com/neringga/VirtualLibrary.git

We recommend running application on MS Visual Studio.

## Requirements for the first part:

* Creating and using your own class, struct and enum (with flag(s), preferably).

* Property (standard, indexed, auto-implemented) usage in struct and class.

* Named and optional argument usage.

* Extension method usage.

* Reading from file.

* Generic type usage.

* Regex.

* Widening and narrowing type conversions.

* Putting data to collection, iterating through it the right way.

* LINQ to Objects usage (methods and queries), including groupJoin.

* Implementing some of the standard .NET interfaces (IEnumerable, IComparable, IComparer, IEquatable, IEnumerator, etc.)
